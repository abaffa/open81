# Version 2.5

This version applies the canonical bug-fixes to the Version 2 ROM while retaining all entry points prior to the `calculate` routine. Unlike some ZX81 ROMs, `IF 1/4<>0.25 THEN PRINT "BUG"` does not throw an error. It includes floating-point speed improvements from SE Basic IV, including the square root routine by Andy Wright from the [SAM Coup√© ROM](https://github.com/cheveron/samrom).
