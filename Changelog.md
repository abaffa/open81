# Version 2.5

This version applies the canonical bug-fixes to the Version 2 ROM while retaining all entry points prior to the `calculate` routine. Unlike some ZX81 ROMs, `IF 1/4<>0.25 THEN PRINT "BUG"` does not throw an error. It includes floating-point speed improvements from SE Basic IV, including the square root routine by Andy Wright from the [SAM Coup√© ROM](https://github.com/cheveron/samrom).

`01_restart.asm`
* Added version number after `next_ch` restart.
* Call to `calculate` now goes to a different address.

`10_expresion.asm`
* Added `l_enter_1` entry point.
* Fixed bug in `nxt_dgt_1`.

`11_arithmetic.asm`
* Added comments from SE Basic IV.
* Fixed bug in `out_zeros`.
* Fixed bug in `count_one`.

`13_font.asm`
* Added `org` to `font`.
